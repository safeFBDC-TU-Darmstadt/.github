# safeFBDC @ TU Darmstadt

This site contains the software prototypes developed during research in the safeFBDC project at TU Darmstadt. Each repository is its own project with source code and documentation. This document gives a short overview of all projects. These are the results of Milestone L1.16 "Final Platform Prototype TruFinance".

**Not all projects are currently publicly available.** If you are a member of the safeFBDC project, DLR, BMWK or other associated partner, you can reach out to [Adrian Lutsch](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/systems/systems_tuda/group/team_detail_117568.en.jsp) for access and/or a download link.

## Content Overview

- **[PWN](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/PWN)** This repository is the official implementation of Predictive Whittle Networks (PWN) introduced in the paper titled [Predictive Whittle Networks for Time Series](https://ml-research.github.io/papers/yu2022whittle.pdf) by Zhongjie Yu, Fabrizio Ventola, Nils Thoma, Devendra Singh Dhami, Martin Mundt, and Kristian Kersting, published at UAI 2022.
- **[FEATHERS](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/FEATHERS)** is a prototype for federated architecture and hyperparameter search during federated learning for neural networks.
- **[CONFEDMADE](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/CONFEDMADE)** This repository is the official Tensorflow 2 implementation of [Masked Autoencoders are Efficient Continual Federated Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03542).
- **[Tractable Dropout Inference](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/tractable-dropout-inference)** Code for our paper "Probabilistic Circuits That Know What They Don't Know" accepted at UAI 2023 ([Paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v216/ventola23a.html), [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06544)).
- **[Rescala RDT Data Architecture Demonstrator](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/rescala-rdt-data-architecture-demonstrator)** demonstrates how the REScala project and replicated data types can be used to design an interactive application that makes use of one or more services within an arbitrary ad-hoc network.
- **[Second Generation SGX Benchmark](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/second_gen_sgx_benchmark)** contains the code for our performance study on database primitives in SGX enclaves.
- **[sgx4ml](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/sgx4ml)** contains the code for our performance study on machine learning in SGX enclaves using the SGX SDK and Gramine Library OS.
- **Additional and more Detailed SGX Benchmarks** (Access upon request)
- **[QFilter](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/QFilter)** is a fine-grained access control enforcement mechanism tightly integrated with query processing over secret-shared data.
- **[SafeML](https://github.com/safeFBDC-TU-Darmstadt/SafeML)** is a distributed machine learning framework designed to address privacy and Byzantine robustness concerns throughout the training and inference phases of a machine learning model.
- **TRUFL** is a system that enables trust and privacy in a federated online analytical processing (OLAP) setting. (Access upon request)
- **[HAP1 Prototype](https://safefbdc-tu-darmstadt.github.io/HAP1-Prototype/)** This repository contains the first prototype website available under <https://safefbdc-tu-darmstadt.github.io/HAP1-Prototype/>. It is the result of Milestone L1.14 "1. Platform Prototype TruFinance".
